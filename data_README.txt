# Exploratory Analysis of Stress–Strain Data for 316L Stainless Steel

## Objective
This project analyzes experimental tensile stress–strain data of 316L stainless steel to clean, visualize, and extract basic mechanical insights in preparation for machine learning applications in materials engineering.

## Dataset
The dataset contains experimental stress–strain measurements obtained from uniaxial tensile tests conducted at different strain rates for 316L stainless steel.

## Methods
- Loaded and cleaned experimental stress–strain data
- Sorted data to preserve physical deformation order
- Visualized raw stress–strain behavior
- Applied rolling average smoothing to reduce experimental noise
- Extracted key mechanical indicators

## Key Results
- Maximum observed stress: **1010.6**
- Strain at maximum stress: **0.514**

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Next Steps
The processed dataset will be used for machine learning models to predict stress from strain and strain-rate features.
